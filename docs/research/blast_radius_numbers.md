The table below summarizes the average daily price change (absolute dollar movement and percentage relative to starting price) for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) over the past 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year (365 days):
Asset	30-Day Avg Change	30-Day Avg Change	90-Day Avg Change	90-Day Avg Change	365-Day Avg Change	365-Day Avg Change
(Absolute, USD)	(% of price)	(Absolute, USD)	(% of price)	(Absolute, USD)	(% of price)

Notes: These figures indicate the average absolute daily move (“blast radius”) and its percentage of the day’s starting price. For example, over the last 30 days Bitcoin moved about $1.24K per day, which is roughly 1.1% of its price on average. Ethereum’s daily swings averaged around $72 (~2.4%), and Solana’s about $4.3 (~2.5%) in the past month. Longer time frames show somewhat larger typical moves, reflecting periods of higher volatility (e.g. Bitcoin’s ~1.5% daily over 90 days, and ~2.0% over the past year). These values are derived from historical price data and illustrate the scale of day-to-day volatility for each asset
